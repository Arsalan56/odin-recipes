    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The popularity of dumplings has skyrocketed all across the world. More and more individuals are experimenting with fresh and intriguing flavors, pairing them, and producing completely original dumplings that are novel in flavor and texture. Due to these experiments, it is now more difficult to define what dumplings are, but let's give it a shot! Dumplings are tiny, bite-sized sweets with a variety of fillings that are encased in a thin layer of dough in Asian cuisines. You have a choice between boiling, steaming, and frying them, and they can be both savory and sweet. The dumpling, also known as jiaozi in Chinese or gyoza in Japanese, is a staple of many people's regular diets and favorite Asian dishes.</p>
    <p>Flour, water, and salt are the three primary components of the dumpling dough. The type of dumpling you wish to make will determine the flour you use. Har Gau (Chinese shrimp dumplings) are prepared using a combination of wheat and tapioca starch, and that's only the beginning! Most dumplings may be created with a normal "dumpling" or "wheat" flour. Dumplings are fantastic in terms of filling because, like the Bao Bun, they are adaptable. You can customize your dumpling to your taste and mood, whether you have a sweet craving or prefer a more savory snack.</p>
