    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lamb kabob, sometimes referred to as kebab or kabob, is a cuisine with Middle Eastern and Central Asian roots. It is thought to have its roots in the Ottoman Empire, where soldiers and herders on the go frequently ate it. It was a convenient and transportable supper because the lamb was marinated and roasted over an open fire on skewers. Since then, lamb kabob has gained popularity across the globe, with variations using various cuts of meat and seasonings.</p>
    <p>You must first marinate the lamb in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and spices like cumin, coriander, and paprika before making lamb kabob. The lamb should be divided into small pieces and marinated for at least one hour, ideally overnight, in the refrigerator. After marinating, the lamb can be threaded onto skewers with veggies like bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions. After that, broil the skewers over medium-high heat until the lamb is done to your preference. In addition to flatbread or rice, the lamb kabob can be served with a side of salad or vegetables.</p>
