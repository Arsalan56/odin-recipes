    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lamb kabob, sometimes referred to as kebab or kabob, is a cuisine with Middle Eastern and Central Asian roots. It is thought to have its roots in the Ottoman Empire, where soldiers and herders on the go frequently ate it. It was a convenient and transportable supper because the lamb was marinated and roasted over an open fire on skewers. Since then, lamb kabob has gained popularity across the globe, with variations using various cuts of meat and seasonings.</p>
    <p>You must first marinate the lamb in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and spices like cumin, coriander, and paprika before making lamb kabob. The lamb should be divided into small pieces and marinated for at least one hour, ideally overnight, in the refrigerator. After marinating, the lamb can be threaded onto skewers with veggies like bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions. After that, broil the skewers over medium-high heat until the lamb is done to your preference. In addition to flatbread or rice, the lamb kabob can be served with a side of salad or vegetables.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lamb</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Marinade</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by trimming excess fat from the lamb. Cut the meat into cubes, just over an inch large. Mix the marinade ingredients.</li>
        <li>Lamb cubes should be well covered in marinade in a nonreactive container, covered, and chilled for up to 24 hours. Overnight is ideal.</li>
        <li>Organize the skewers (discard remaining marinade). You can roast the tomatoes and the lamb on separate skewers for as long as is necessary. Limit your packing.</li>
        <li>Set the grill to medium-high heat and brush high-smoke point oil over the grates to create a non-stick surface. Grill the shish kebab for 8 to 12 minutes, flipping it frequently. Depending on how soft you like your tomatoes, grill the tomatoes for however long is necessary. While the meat is roasting, reheat some flatbread.</li>
